Your guide to contents depreciation recovery. 
Your property policy may contain a replacement cost provision that allows for the recovery of depreciation on items that are 
purchased within the policy-specified timeframe. If it does, then your Adjuster Summary that accompanies this guide will show any 
applicable recoverable depreciation amounts. 
Please make sure that the following 
information is addressed when submitting 
receipts for depreciation reimbursement 
consideration: 
1. Receipts must be legible 
2. Items on receipts should be 
numbered consistent with the item 
description on the Adjuster 
Summary (example below) 
3. The receipt should contain: the 
store name, date of purchase, item 
descriptions and quantities, order 
number (for online purchases), 
payment method and total including 
any applicable taxes or shipping 
fees 
4. Additional documentation may be 
required for specific purchase types. 
Your adjuster can help clarify what 
is needed for your claim 
Example of Adjuster Summary: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You can upload your clear, labeled receipts to the Documents tab on MyClaim or send them to claims@claims.allstate.com with your 
claim number in the subject line for reimbursement consideration. 
------- 
This is an instructional guide on how to submit receipts for consideration of reimbursement on covered recoverable depreciation and does not confer coverage that is 
outside of your policy. It is subject to your policy terms, conditions, exclusions and limitations.  
Any person who knowingly and with intent to injure, defraud, or deceive any insurer files a statement of claim or an application containing any false, incomplete, or 
misleading information may be guilty of a crime and may be subject to prosecution under applicable state law.

Depending upon the circumstances of your loss, our estimate may or may not include an amount for general contractor's overhead
and profit.  If you have questions regarding general contractor's overhead and profit and whether the services of a general
contractor are appropriate for your loss, please contact your claim representative before proceeding with repairs.
This document includes a damage estimate for your property based on Replacement Cost Value (RCV) and Actual Cash Value
(ACV). The ACV estimate reflects the RCV less the amount of any depreciation.  Depreciation is the decrease in value of an

replacement of the covered damages.
During the claim process, we asked for your assistance in establishing the age and condition of your damaged items. If you have
any questions regarding the age and condition applied to your property, or any other questions regarding this estimate, please
contact your adjuster.
Specialized skill, licensing or certification may be needed of any contractor(s) that you retain, for instance, to identify the
presence and nature of any potential contaminants, toxins, pollutants, or other hazards that may be encountered during the course
of the work, or to utilize appropriate work practices and procedures during the course of the work. Check with your local or State
public health or environmental agency regarding potential hazards, including contractor qualifications and other requirements.
For your safety, it is prudent to avoid areas where damaged structures, materials or unknown substances may be present, and to
not disturb such structures, material, or unknown substances until your contractors have inspected the work site.
The suggestions above are provided only for your consideration. They in no way supplement, alter or modify your existing
coverage.  Your insurance policy is the legal contract that contains the terms and limitations of your coverage.
If you have any concerns about the grade of flooring on your estimate, you may take advantage of a free service that will provide
you with a more specific analysis. To use this option, please keep a 12" x 12" sample of your damaged flooring, and notify your
Allstate adjuster that you would like the additional analysis.
